# Rock-Paper-Scissors-bot
This program for Arduino will play Rock, Paper, Scissors with you, and while doing so, it learns how to beat you! After a while it won't ever lose! Play it using the Serial port on your computer, and Arduino's knowledge can be erased by simply resetting the board or by re-uploading the sketch!
